# Read_Temperature  
-This project utilizes Atmega32 microcontroller,LM35 sensor,LCD (16x2)character and Keypad

# Driver Implemented:  
1-DIO driver
2-LCD driver  
3-ADC driver    
4-KPD driver
-when you enter the correct password , you will login the sustem and read Temperature and write its value on LCD and you only have 3 attempts to try it.If you enter the password incorrectly more than 3 times, the system will shut down for 5 seconds.
